It’s me. You got the goods?
Yes. Just to confirm: we’re meeting at 7PM at the docks?

Hi, it’s Daisy from Bunny Publishing.
Yes?
I’m calling about your subscription to XXL Pizza Lovers’ Monthly.

Hi, this is Sal from the electronics store.
Oh, hi! Is this about my fridge?
No it’s about your butt!
You again?! These aren’t even good prank calls!

Mom?
Where are you? I’ve been worried sick!
I’m fine, I’m just at Abigail’s. We’re studying.
Is that dance music I hear in the background?

Did you just say “click” into the phone?
Gotta go! Bye.

Hello, this is Phil from Howlin’ Music. I’m calling about the marimba you ordered.

You can play me off when I leave.

Hi, this is Nancy from Hammy’s Home And Hosiery. How can I help?
How do I put these on? I’ve haven’t got any leg holes in my hosiery.

Not a one.
I believe you may have purchased a tea cosy.

Oh it was. Waste. Everywhere.
Didn’t quite make the splash you thought it would, huh?
